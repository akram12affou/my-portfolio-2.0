      Hey, I'm Akram, a nineteen-year-old from Morocco diving into the coding universe. Last year, I discovered the magic of programming online and decided, "Yep, that's my thing!" I set sail for web developmentâ€”it's like the central hub of cool coding stuff. Bagged a <span className="tech hover:underline cursor-pointer"> 2-year web dev degree at ISTA NTIC </span> , where I learned front-end, back-end, and everything in between. No boring lectures; it was all about hands-on projects and teamwork. Now, armed with problem-solving skills, I'm ready to ride the waves of the dynamic web development world!
